# Project Name

## How is this problem solved currently (if at all)?

While there are applications out there that allow you to guess the song based off of the lyrics or off of the music, they lack diversity. They are one dimensional, only giving the user the option of the lyrics or the music, depending on the application. [APP] will allow the user to choose how they want to play the game, allowing them to choose which mode they would prefer to play. All of the current applications are also targeted towards a mobile market, not currently available in a real time format on the web. On the web, the problem is solved with online quizzes.

## How will this project make life better? Is it educational or just for entertainment?

<<<<<<< HEAD
[APP] is a party game, where the players are groups of friends or strangers that compete against one another in a fast-paced game of guessing the song title, artist, or missing lyrics that is associated with a short 10-15seconds music clip that plays. The aim of [APP] is to provide entertainment and a fun activity for groups of friends or strangers to play on weekends, game nights, trivia nights, bars, etc. which gives them an opportunity to socialize and create closer bonds amongst each other, and make new friends. While, [APP] is more focused on providing entertainment, it does indirectly help make life easier by relieving stress and creating friendships through the fun gameplay and socialization opportunities.

## Who is the target audience?

Our target audience for [APP] is aimed towards young adults who are interested in playing party type games with their own friend groups. As well as, adults who are looking to socialize and create new friendships.

## Does this project have many individual features, or one main feature (possibility with many subproblems)? These are the ‘epics’ of your project.

### Song guessing

### Leaderboards
Leaderboards will provide users the opportunity to compete with their friends and to show off their knowledge of music. For each category of music (rock, hip-hop, modern) there will be two leaderboards associated with it: one for single-player and one for multiplayer. As well as a single and multiplayer global leaderboard that takes the cumulative score of all categories.  Leaderboards will contain the rankings of the top players, their win-loss ratio, how many ranks they gained in the past week and their score. Scores will determine the rankings of the top players on the leaderboards and will be referenced from a user’s profile. Scores will be determined by how quickly a user answers correctly. Leaderboards will be updated periodically every 3 hours (tentative).

### Profiles

### Multiplayer

For the multiplayer aspect of the application, we would have a lot of different options as how we want to match players. We will give them the opportunity to compete against their friends, being able to send invitations to those they wish to compete against (potentially via social media). We will also be able to match players based off of the same rankings that are used in the scoreboards to ensure that we are matching players to other players with a matching skill level. 

## What are some sample stories/scenarios? For example, as a regular user to your site, what types of things can I do? These are the ‘stories’ of your project.

Any user would be able to log in to their unique account and be given the option to either create a party,join a party, or start a solo game. If the user chose to create a party then others would be able to join the party using a password and they could play a multiplayer match. When playing, users will be given the option to pick their genre or era of music as well as the option of if they would like to play the standard text input version,  a multiple-choice version or potentially even a speech to text version. For example, if the user chose the text input version, they would be prompted to type the name of the song and artist after the sample snipper of the song has been done playing. If the user chose multiple choice version, there would be four choices to pick from and the user would need to select one. Each user would also have the option of viewing their personal leaderboards or global leader boards to check high scores and win/loss records.


## Is the amount of work required in this proposal enough for five group members?

Yes, we believe it to be enough work. We plan on implementing different modes of play, such as text input, multiple choice, and potentially speech recognition. Along with options of multiplayer or solo play. There will also be the task of implementing two API’s, one for displaying the lyrics and the other for getting the artist and song information. Lastly, we would need to deal with the creation of profiles and linking these them to leaderboards.
